# Research Log
*Alain Chauffoureaux*

##### Starting to read and prepare interactions data:
I slowly started to read Web of Life raw data and think about the next steps.
Next week, I will need to start:
* Formatting data on species (as a table with species information)
* Cleaning species names (merging synonyms, resolving weird names)
* Formatting data on interactions (as a table with information on each interaction for each network)
* Format interactions metadata by adding a column for location ID and the possibility to assign locations manually

##### Jake's feedback on the outline:
Today I received feedback from Jake about the outline.
In particular, he made the following points:
* Think some more about your hypotheses regarding how the different factors I mention will influence the fidelity of interactions
* Make sure I am crystal clear about the logical flow between ideas --- the development of ideas towards the main goal of the study are not obvious yet
* Think about a plan-B in case things go wrong --- the project is quite ambitious
* Technically, in the opportunism-fidelity spectrum, the two ends are perfect non-random fidelity and perfect non-random infidelity, with random opportunism as a middle ground
* Minor point: be clear that by existence of pairwise interactions I mean the probability of an interaction between a given pair of species

##### Starting the research log:
Starting to write the research log here.
The project began on March.
Until now, I have done some literature search, read *Statistical Rethinking* --- a book on Bayesian statistics ---, written the outline, prepared the docker container, and started to download the data.
